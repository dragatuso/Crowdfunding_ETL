# Crowdfunding_ETL
This repository contains the jupyter notebook file with the code (ETL_Mini_Project_Starter_Code (DR - DT).ipynb), the database schema resulting from sketching an ERD of the tables by using QuickDBD (crowdfunding_db_schema.sql), the code used for creating the tables and inputing the values from the csv files in the crowdfund database (crowdfunding_db) and a Resources folder that includes the initial excel files (crowdfund.xlsx and contacts.xlsx) and the generated csv files (campaign.csv, category.csv, contacts.csv and subcategory.csv).
Most of the code was developed based on the exerciuses reviewed and complete during class. We also googled some part of the code and asked chat gpt for suggestions.
